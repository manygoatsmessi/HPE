In some cases, unstable or damaged mental health can lead to severe consequences, and unfortunately, many people affected end up committing suicide. This report aims to analyze the services and information provided by Lifeline, including its impact on all areas of health, not limited to mental health. Furthermore, it will report on the reliability of the resource, focusing on the recency of information and the reliability of its sources. In the end, it will be able to identify whether Lifeline is as reputable as it is portrayed.</b>

Today, it is Australia’s largest mental support service. The service encompasses support with a variety of issues, listed in the next section. Patients may contact experts by calling, texting or talking with them online. These methods are all available on the Lifeline website.</b><br><b class="paragraph-section transition">In addition, the website offers a comprehensive amount of mental health tools, techniques and real peoples’ stories on their toolkit website, so that help is available even if one wishes not to talk to anyone. This information is likely made by expert employees at Lifeline to provide the most effective ways of crisis management, based on prior experience and knowledge. The services require just a browser and internet, but there also exists some amount of real facilities spread across the country. While such facilities are generally minimal, it is later discussed how the organisation may help the underprivileged people in society</b>

It is stated clearly that callers will not be judged or told what to do.[7] For those who have been affected so deeply that they are unwilling to communicate, even by online chat, the resources offered on the website, including real stories about others’ experiences with Lifeline[8] and their overcoming of issues, articles and guides with advice about coping with certain issues (see categorical support ), as well as links to several other services and apps, including WayAhead, Kids Helpline, Beyond Blue, SANE, Daybreak, Managing Panic Program, This Way Up, Depression and Anxiety program, and many more.[9] [10] Furthermore, there are a variety of research topic on mental health [11] which look at the causes and ongoing actions on suicide and other emotional crisis related topics.</b>

          <p><b class="paragraph-section transition">The fact that Lifeline is a mental health support website means that the effect it directly has on physical health is generally minimal. However, it is often true that the different areas of health are often influenced by the conditions of one another. For example, a decline in physical health, may result in a decline in one’s emotional and social health. Thus, the improvements that Lifeline gives to one’s emotional health can indirectly translate to a increase in physical health.</b><br><b class="paragraph-section transition">A possible illustration would be a person experiencing trauma from the death of a loved one. This event may cause significant psychological damage, perhaps causing them to become depressed and unwilling to do anything. For their physical health, this may result in less physical action, perhaps less commitment to sport, other physical activities or possibly healthy eating, thus resulting in possible weight gain, detrimental to physical health. However, those who come to Lifeline with severe, near-suicidal conditions, Lifeline provides an obvious, vital role to their physical health. Death may be defined the complete destruction of all areas of one's health, so the organisation would, in such a situation, directly affect the physical aspect of health.</b>
