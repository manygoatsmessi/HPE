Furthermore, it will report on the reliability of the resource, focusing on the recency of information and the reliability of its sources.

Founded in 1963 by Australian theologian Alan Walker after witnessing the suicide of a man in crisis, the service now has 3,500 Crisis Support members, over 40 centers and facilities; some 1,000 employees and 10,000 volunteers. Today, it is Australia’s largest mental support service. The service encompasses support with a variety of issues, listed in the next section. Patients may contact the support team by calling, texting or talking with them online. These methods are all available on the Lifeline website.</b><br><b class="paragraph-section transition">In addition, the website offers a comprehensive amount of mental health tools, techniques and real peoples’ stories on their toolkit website, so that help is available even if one wishes not to talk to anyone. This information is likely made by expert employees at Lifeline to provide the most effective ways of crisis management, based on prior experience and knowledge. The services require just a browser and internet, but there also exists some amount of real facilities spread across the country. While such facilities are generally minimal, it is later discussed how the organisation may help the underprivileged people in society</b>

          <p><b class="paragraph-section transition">The fact that Lifeline is a mental health support website means that the effect it directly has on physical health is generally minimal. However, it is often true that the different areas of health are often influenced by the conditions of one another. For example, a decline in physical health, may result in a decline in one’s emotional and social health. Thus, the improvements that Lifeline gives to one’s emotional health can indirectly translate to a increase in physical health.</b><br><b class="paragraph-section transition">A possible illustration would be a person experiencing trauma from the death of a loved one. This event may cause significant psychological damage, perhaps causing them to become depressed and unwilling to do anything. For their physical health, this may result in less physical action, perhaps less commitment to sport, other physical activities or possibly healthy eating, thus resulting in possible weight gain, detrimental to physical health. However, those who come to Lifeline with severe, near-suicidal conditions, Lifeline provides an obvious, vital role to their physical health. Death may be defined the complete destruction of all areas of one's health, so the organisation would, in such a situation, directly affect the physical aspect of health.</b>

          <p><b class="paragraph-section transition">Compared to physical health, a person’s social health is generally more closely intertwined with the improvements and declines in emotional health. An extremely frequent example is that of periods of sadness or depression. As said previously, these symptoms are a result of many different events or experiences. People who are affected are often quiet, unwilling to talk speak or socialize. This alone makes it more difficult to create or maintain friendships with peers, especially if the effected person has not expressed their feelings and issues to them.</b><br><b class="paragraph-section transition">Moreover, Lifeline provides support to not only the individual, but also the people around them. The service includes resources for those who are worried about someone else: family members, friends, or anyone else whose health may be of concern to them. This way, an affected person may receive help even if they do not specifically request for it themselves. Sadly, due to many potential factors, those in need of support not reaching out may be a fairly common possibility. This report will go into more detail about this issue in the following section.

          <p><b class="paragraph-section transition">While there were 171 specialized mental health service organizations across Australia in 2021 to 2022, many people, especially adolescents, fail to contact such services. Those with a low income or a low socioeconomic status are more likely to live far from urban areas where mental health facilities are less concentrated, with minimal or no access to internet services such as Lifeline. However, another common occurrence, applies to those who have access to services, however, often as a result of psychological factors, are prevented from doing so.</b><br><b class="paragraph-section transition">Commonly, people may see finding help as a sign of “weakness”, or fear that others see it that way. Others may have attempted to find help before, perhaps by using a different method, but found that it yielded no results. Furthermore, language, cultural and religious barriers are also often a factor in causing difficulties accessing information and services.</b><br><b class="paragraph-section transition">Disabilities are also a possible issue, especially for the elderly. Hearing or speaking disabilities are problematic since it makes people unable to talk to staff. Unfortunately, people often look for help as a result of disabilities, and it is unfavorable that they might me prevented access for the same reason. Furthermore, affected individuals may find the prospect of talking to people extremely uncomfortable, even to mental health assisters.

          <p><b class="paragraph-section transition">Lifeline and other mental health services all face the previously mentioned challenges. Since many of the factors that prevent people from accessing services are determined by a person’s willingness to use the services, on this part, there is not much they can do. However, there are many challenges that they can do something about. Many services including Lifeline offer support for those unwilling to talk via calls by utilizing online text and messaging. Furthermore, there are guides and articles with in-depth information and links to other resources about a range of issues people may face.</b><br><b class="paragraph-section transition">In addition, by constructing more facilities in rural and suburban areas, Lifeline can improve access to their services. However, many services suggested by Lifeline such as <a href="https://rrmh.com.au/">Rural and Mental Health</a>, <a href="https://yougotthismate.com.au/">You Got This Mate</a> and <a href="https://www.ruralaid.org.au/">Rural Aid</a> are already supporting low income, rural and remote communities. As for cultural and language barriers, Lifeline uses TIS National, a free interpreting service, to provide service and calls to those who cannot speak English, as well as NRS for those with hearing or speaking disabilities. Both TIS National and NRS are initiatives by the Australian Government.

          <p><b class="paragraph-section transition">As Australia’s largest mental health support website, supported and funded considerably by various state governments, it is hard for Lifeline to be considered unreliable. Nevertheless, a reliability analysis is nonetheless essential. While the service is not government-run, substantial funding in the millions of Australian Dollars is provided by the Federal and State Governments.</b><br><b class="paragraph-container transition">There are no hints of advertising on the Lifeline website, where almost every page is dedicated to support and information. The only areas looking for money are the fundraising and donation sections. While merchandise exists, it is scarcely mentioned in the site, appearing only in the header navigation area. Any data from external sources, such as on the <a href="https://www.lifeline.org.au/resources/data-and-statistics/">data and statistics</a> page, have the sources clearly stated (in this case, mostly the government sources <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/">ABS</a> and <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/">AIHW</a>). Additionally, there exist statistics about the service itself and the information provided are guides on how to cope with and overcome certain issues. No external sources of information were found for these articles, possibly because they were created especially for Lifeline. However, this was unable to be confirmed. Likewise, such information generally does not need to be kept up to date, as there is no real change that could occur in these guides. There is, however, a feedback section under the articles, suggesting that the site is probably consistently updated.

With three ways of communicating with trained professional mental health supporters, the service also includes a comprehensive library with tools, information and guides on how to deal with and overcome traumatic or stressful experiences and situations. While it focuses on mental health, the services and help it provides can affect the entirety of one’s health, and the improvements made to their mental health can cause an increase in their physical and social health.</b><br><b class="paragraph-container transition">Although there was no evidence that the guides were, it is unlikely that they weren’t, especially since the guides on mental health likely rely on experience rather than external research. Although there are merchandise, marketing and donations available, there was no clearly visible evidence of advertising within the website. In conclusion, the website’s reliability and availability is what makes it the largest support resource in Australia.
